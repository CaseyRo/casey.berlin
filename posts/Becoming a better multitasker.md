# Becoming a better multitasker

_is this clickbait? Let’s say it is. Reality is that more of us need to ‘switch contexts’ more times a day then a lightbulb in it’s lifetime, might as well get better at it!_

## Tip 1: Don’t Switch Contexts (often)
The less you can switch contexts the better. Try to look at this from a structured approach. Can you:

1. Change your projects you work on (private or professionally), so you can work on it on specific days, to specific time(slots) or not at all? Do it.
2. Put your projects you don’t _must_ do on the shelf. All, including those coding courses you wanted to take and the domains you bought for your next best in class app.
3. Projects that can be delegated, need input from others, need dedicated thinking time? Act on that instinct. Delegate, ask for help, schedule.
4. Organise your agenda in a way that you have limited appointment times? A ‘meeting less’ day? Then do it.

## Tip 2: If You Have To, Contextualise.
For the sake of the example, this is what I like (and my brain works well with)
1. I have a lot of project meetings strictly in German, even if I could request we do them in English, I will happily decline. My brain attaches a context, a set of knowledge and a routine of working and talking to that language.
2. My work as team lead, and in our organisation, usually is in English. Great, there is no ‘compartment’ in my head that creates paths between my projects and my work environment (even though it sometimes must)
3. My “home” surroundings currently are in Dutch due to covid, my partner speaks Dutch (and Frysian) — we have our context there.

## Tip 3: Change Contexts More.
If you don’t speak that languages or are not able to contextualise, try it in a different way. A few examples:

1. Always open your mailbox and respond to mails **standing up** (a walking setup would be even better). This automatically creates a more active approach, limits the size of your response and *hopefully* turns into a ‘getting things done’ posture more.
2. go outside for the next call with your manager or team members. Your brain will feel better, and you’ll enjoy the perspective of the next meeting (=being outside) more.
3. Enjoy meetings you know you have less input on from the couch, watch a webinar from a lazy chair or listen to a podcast in the kitchen or the car.
4. Use a different device to do certain tasks. The iPad is the best mail reader and responder there is, simply because it distracts less. My car is my best podcast device, closely followed by food prep using a decent set of earplugs.

## To Conclude
That you made it this far is a great achievement! Again, multitasking isn’t what we’re made for — we’re much better of sticking to one box — but who knows, these tips might help.

Be aware that you might feel powerful or have a holy sh•t moment trying these tips. The same goes for reading GTD or trying Pomodoro. The long term effect is the opposite though, you’ll find yourself pulling in even more tasks and adding things to your stack.

If you’re looking for the conclusion, the TLDR, this is my mega tip: 

**Say no. More often/clearly/repeatedly than you do now**.
