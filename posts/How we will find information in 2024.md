So this is a real 100 billion dollar question – which will need time to figure out where we're really going. Just my short consideration, looking at it from a 'restaurant' metaphor.

1. There will always be people eating 'classical' dinners, coming onto the web using a browser on their phone looking for 'textual' information, having used it like that 'all the time' and things don't need to change. Those are the people not using voice assistants either because of privacy reasons or those of us too old for snapchat.   
      
    Those people are possibly also the ones with the biggest wallets at the moment – for them SEO will stay relevant for a while.  
     
2. There are people coming to the restaurant for a surprise dinner, a new experience every time, letting the sommelier decide what wine to drink and considering the restaurant to be a social gathering, not a bottom pyramid Maslow need.  
      
    Those people happily order their new shoes on instagram, enjoy the ease of a voice assistant and probably be the first ones to have enjoyed genAI for creating their christmas cards.   
      
    The information they need is not really 'spidered' on websites, but rather in meta formats. Endpoints that provide data, more fluid content fitting to an experience (be that a voice, text or visual representation) and much less tied together by hyperlinks or sitemaps.  
      
    Their relationship with information is also the tension I see with fake news, online hate speech etc. Moderation is needed.  
      
    And that's where my third use case comes around.
