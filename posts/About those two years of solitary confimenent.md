# About those two years of solitary confimenent
We’re almost out! Corona is behind us! New ideas, a blank canvas, a plot to draw! Did we really stand still all the time? Or did we missed an opportunity?

A torn story unfolded, from my personal perspective.

## Back to normal? Or has normal held us back?
I know very well how I felt in March 2020, 2 years ago. I felt put on pause, uncertain, waiting for things to pass.

Even though I only just started my new job, me being my unconfident self, getting to know new colleagues, trying to stand out a bit here and there, spending too much energy in things that only slightly touch the boundaries of my job.

I felt I had to put myself, and my progress, on pause. At least for a few days.

I considered my position — an apartment for a great price in Berlin, a fresh fiancee, a wedding planned and almost funded — and the opportunities in a new job. 
Being a “manager” of sorts (even though a Product Owner isn’t really) it would take time to adjust to “working from home”, but even that felt like a win.

But there’s also the other end, where my fiancee works in tourism in Berlin, with a niche carved out in Dutch stone, with closing borders and tight restrictions in place. We had to adjust our lives.

## Two years later
I’m currently sitting on the couch and waiting again. For a war to pass in the Ukraine, the final corona rules to be lifted, the day turning into night, day 400+ ‘working from home’ the reality we live with.

I’m tired. Not from the move out of Berlin into a small community, not from engaging in challenging projects and successfully growing myself at diconium. Not from rebuilding and decorating a house to turn into a home. But tired from waiting for it all to be over.

I have a history of depression and anxiety, putting the expectations on myself and my surroundings so high, that no one can reach it (and I feel I implode). 

I have a constant sense of that corona shroud still covering us all with fear and anxiety. With the endless struggle of getting up in the morning and going for the next day ‘from home’, fighting the time away, perhaps letting other people’s more ‘motivated’ spirits be a guidance for a moment, even though that is toxic. We’re all just tired fighting.

## What the ideal future might look like
I visualize to reach my goals, if I can’t see it I don’t think it should exist. I hope to be back in the gym soon, to enjoy a work-out, go into the office after and meet up with colleagues. Enjoy lunch in an overly crowded Berlin restaurant, discussing where to get that afternoon jolt of espresso to go (because there are so many).

I talk in 1:1’s with colleagues and friends about their experiences, how they’re dealing with the extra inputs and dress-ups happening because there simply is an office again. If only I would feel je-ne-sais-quoi enough to go to the office in my jogging pants.

I only go there once, maybe twice a week. I visit colleagues in Portugal more often than I did before, if only for the better weather and relaxter lifestyle. 

My evenings take place on our terrace outside, reading a magazine or doing some garden work. Cooking with fresh veggies from the garden, BBQ’ing with friends or neighbors. 

We travel often, to family or friends — a luxury I could only dream of (or sneak in hoping no one noticed)
