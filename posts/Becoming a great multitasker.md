# Becoming a great multitasker

_is this clickbait? Let’s say it is. Reality is that more of us need to ‘switch contexts’ more often per day then a lightbulb in it’s lifetime, so let’s get well at it!_

## Tip 1: Don’t switch contexts (often)
The less you can switch contexts the better. Try to look at this from a structured approach. Can you:

1. Change your projects you work on (private or professionally) so you can work on it on specific days, specific times or perhaps not at all? Meaning;
2. Put your projects you really don’t _must_ do on the shelf. All of them, including those coding courses you definitely wanted to take and the domains you bought for your next best in class app.
3. Order your agenda in a way that you have limited appointment times? A ‘meeting less’ day? Then go for it.

## Tip 2: If you have to, contextualise.
For the sake of the example, this is what I like (and my brain seems to work well with too)
1. I have a lot of project meetings strictly in German, even if I could request we do them in English, I will happily decline. My brain attaches a context, a set of knowledge and a routine of working and talking to that language.
2. My work as team lead, but also in our organisation, mostly is in English. Great, so there is no ‘compartment’ in my head that creates paths between my projects and my work environment (even though it sometimes must)
3. My “home” surroundings currently are mostly in Dutch due to covid, my partner also speaks Dutch (and Frysian) so we have our context there.

If you don’t speak that languages or are not able to contextualise as such, try it in a different way. A few examples:

1. Always open your mailbox and respond to mails standing up (a walking setup would be even better). This automatically creates a more active approach, limits the size of your response and _mostly_ turns into a ‘getting things done’ approach more.
2. go outside for the next call with your manager or team members. Your brain will feel better, and you’ll enjoy the perspective of the next meeting (=being outside) more.
3. Enjoy
