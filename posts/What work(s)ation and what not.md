"Workation" is a portmanteau of "work" and "vacation." It refers to a working vacation, combining work and vacation in a single trip. This term has become increasingly popular in the era of remote work and digital nomadism, where people can work from anywhere with a stable internet connection. This allows them to travel or stay in vacation-like settings while fulfilling their work responsibilities. It's important to note that the specifics of a workation can vary greatly based on individual or company policies and the nature of the work being done.

Last week, I was nestled in the heart of Oberammergau, a charming town in southern Germany known for its breathtaking mountains, delicious brezen, and quintessential weißwurst. We rented a house there, immersing ourselves in the local culture while enjoying the splendid natural beauty surrounding us. As I settled into this new environment, I had the opportunity to explore and experience what a good workation can truly be. After a few days of adjustment, I found my rhythm, striking a perfect balance between work and leisure.

Many have asked me to share my insights on this whole workation concept, and it holds a certain magic when done right. By keeping everyone in the loop and cultivating the proper habits, workations can transform how we perceive work and leisure, blending them into a pleasant experience. So, let's delve into the world of workations, unravel its potential, and understand how it can be successfully implemented.


## 1. Be clear and strict on your schedule
More often than not, workation is enjoyed with other people. You need to align your schedule with them and communicate that.

In my case, this meant either starting the workday a bit later to enjoy an early hike or ending the day earlier – allowing enjoying a fantastic sunset, food and fun with friends or going for a swim without it being too cold.

## 2. Update your colleagues
I've been clear in my work calendar that I won't be available for the time I spend on 'workation' to ensure there are no weird faces.

I can also imagine a workation to be location dependant – you'll probably need an internet connection for it to work well. Park your campervan when you have a meeting, be present and contribute as you would normally.

## 3. Foster an asynchronous culture beforehand
I'm lucky to be working with some fantastic diconium colleagues around the globe, and since we do software development mostly - it's familiar to work asynchronously. 

But there are more people you work with, your manager, perhaps colleagues in HR or a persistent senior that still believes work only happens between 9 and 5. 

Convince them 9 to 5 is no longer the only way to accomplish projects – things _do_ get done even though it's just a JIRA card that has its status updated. There is a benefit to working in that way.

## 4. Enjoy a different routine
As you might have read in my [Apple vision blog](https://casey.berlin/applevision/) – I'm a routine beast. I enjoy knowing what is expected daily, and it can be very productive if planned upfront. Ticking off tasks is something that should be on my LinkedIn!

But, on workation, it doesn't work like that. You might be interrupted by a bad internet connection, get a flat tire while biking, or get stuck in a mountain lake for just one more swim.

This is fine. Going to bed at different times, too, writing a few emails later in the evening that you usually wouldn't. This is _workation_ at its best!

## 5. Don’t apologise 
It can feel unfair towards others that work in the office, or you don't want to disturb them with e-mails late in the evening (schedule them!) – but that's no reason for you to apologise, you deserve a bit of away time, and it will give you new insights and create some distance from things. It refreshes your mind, gives you great ideas, and improves your mental health!

## 6. Be prepared for different energy levels
Since you'll have a different routine and see many new things, it might be hard to pick up work that you would do from home (e.g. coding, deep thinking or meeting marathons), so be ready to do some _different_ work as well. 

There's always this stack of books lying around (Thanks Jamie for bringing tsundoko to my vocabulary), those town hall videos you still need to watch, or that new tool to try out. Workations are excellent for that!

## 7. If workation turns into a routine, better take time off
In my situation, I'm a person that needs a practice to work efficiently. Workation doesn't work for me in that regard, so if I considered a longer workation (longer than a week), I would go for a reduction of hours or even a sabbatical instead. Talk to your HR department if that is something you consider.

I could be more efficient when working from somewhere else, which affects my work quality too. I also tend to sleep a bit less, eat a bit less healthily and do fewer sports – which also affects my health and motivation/energy for work.
