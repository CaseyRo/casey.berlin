I've been asked by a few people what I think about the upcoming Apple Vision or talking about it in Apple's marketing words: "The first steps into spatial computing".

Before we dive in, if you haven't seen Apple's keynote yet about it, check out what The Verge posted to get you up to speed:

## General thoughts
1. The battery life is a problem, but this limitation is quickly solved with enough power bricks and spare batteries until the next generation(s) of glasses demand less and less.
2. Motion sickness will be an issue, 
## Professional context

The vision pro enables more opportunities and possibilities to work 'on the go', regardless of where you are, and that is a killer feature.

Right now, I'm typing this on a way too heavy 16" intel macbook pro, and having to converse chatGPT goes in a different window, trying to find some images too, and let's forget about how awful Outlook is on an intel based mac.

The vision headset would give me a lot more space, serenity and privacy to work in case I need it. I could easily lay out ideas in front of me, gather information using different apps and browse not in tabs but in a virtual world more fluidly than the awkward interactions a trackpad and keyboard give me.

Even a cramped environment like a train or aeroplane would give you more space, and turning a car's backseat (or passenger seat) into a work-friendly environment is an excellent idea, although a bit boring for the driver.

## Private context
I found the "put on your goggles at a children's party" a bit of a weird idea to present a gimmick. Being able to 3d capture a moment with your kids, spouse or dog might be fun, but the headset will absolutely create a new boundary to cross with people that are less digitally native.

If I would be traveling by S-bahn or tram in Berlin for instance, I would be hesitant to put it on. Yes we also got used to headphones and cameras there, but privacy is a big thing in Germany. Who knows what people are secretly doing within their spatial computing world.

Being back home I'd be happy to return the big screen in the living room to watch a show I only like, or have a little gaming session after work. Again I could turn a small desk or kitchen table into a productive environment when needed, but I'm more interested how it can enable garden planning, a DIY project or assist me in repairing things or present electric wiring from a room to my screen.

Since I still love F1 and football, I would love to be able to see statistics, live timing and more than one screen when watching sports. Not annoying my spouse with this would be amazing too! 

Where other headsets have found a nice in fitness, Apple is not at that point yet. I personally wouldn't want to wear any more gadgets I already do during training, and they need to be rock solid when throwing around weights or going all out in a rowing session.

## A day with vision Pro
How would a regular 'day to day' look like for me when I would include vision?

🕖  - 🕗 ➡️  Getting up, making breakfast. This is quiet time. 👓 No need for vision.
🕗  - 🕘 ➡️  The dog needs her walk, drinking coffee, catching up with the news and preparing the day. 👓 I would catch up on news and prepare the day _if I would be alone that day_ 
🕘  - 🕛 ➡️ Mostly meetings. 👓 I can imagine doing this walking around and using the digital avatar features, having some extra real estate to jot down things or sketch stuff. Or play a game.
