Introducing a New Tool in My Arsenal: Custom AI Business Coach

I've developed a custom version of GPT specifically for business idea analysis. It incorporates the lean/business model canvas and is programmed for detailed, critical feedback. This tool is a step forward in refining business strategies with AI insights.

## Why a customGPT?

Custom GPTs make sense for several reasons, especially in a business context:

1. **Tailored Solutions**: By customizing a GPT with specific knowledge bases like the lean/business model canvas, it becomes more aligned with your industry's needs and can offer more relevant advice and insights.

2. **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Custom instructions, such as asking for more details or being super critical, enable the GPT to provide more in-depth analysis and constructive feedback, essential for refining business strategies.

3. **Efficiency and Productivity**: Automating parts of the idea evaluation and strategy development process with a custom GPT can save time and resources, allowing you and your team to focus on other critical aspects of your projects.

4. **Consistency in Analysis**: An AI system offers consistent, unbiased analysis based on the data and parameters set, which can be invaluable in decision-making processes where objectivity is crucial.

5. **Adaptability and Learning**: Custom GPTs can be continuously updated with new information and feedback, making them adaptable and increasingly effective over time.


In summary, custom GPTs can be powerful tools in business environments, offering tailored, efficient, and objective support in strategy development and decision-making.

## What did it bring me?

Well, I've considered several business ideas over the last months, where I would previously already bought a domainname, perhaps did some coding in my spare time, but now I've started talking with my GPT first. So these ideas got cancelled along the way:

1. A drone capture company – sometimes hobbies just need to stay hobbies
2. Becoming a therapist – an idea that is still in progress, it's a bit more than just a business, it will need a lifestyle change

## The future of custom GPTs

There are already a ton of custom GPTs around, some really delivering a lot of value, some a lot less. It takes away a few steps of creating custom instructions, but it might be a hit/miss based on your personal requirements. 

I'm not convinced we need all these custom GPTs to be able to deal with specific parts of our work, but adding custom knowledge might increase the value – a customer service GPT with product information for instance, or loading a GPT with corporate design assets so it can generate powerpoint decks for you. Who knows!
