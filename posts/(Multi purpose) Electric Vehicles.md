This article is in progress, a topic I've been researching and refining. Follow along if you like it.

Next to the known 'new EV manufacturers' and the old school companies playing catch-up, there are some rarities around as well, that I can be very excited about (and also sceptical)

What I love most about these new manufacturers is the way they look at building their vehicles. Technology like ‘microfactories’ (building vehicles with a lot fewer robots than a full assembly line) makes their options a lot more flexible/agile.

A base platform that is the same for each vehicle is something they also have in common. Companies like VW have developed those platforms too, but take a lot longer. Also emerging markets are hard to work with in platforms that need to be supported for probably a decade.

Changing materials from steel, to plastic based, is another significant change. It allows for easier repairs and better maintenance.

Examples of manufacturers I’m tracking:

## NIO
* not that new anymore, also have their HQ in Berlin!

## CANOO MP vehicle

* starting from scratch in the EV environment
* purpose-built
* platform base
* Comes from outside of the EU, much fewer politics

- looks like a concept, not going to happen in the EU in this form.

## ARRIVAL Van

* electric delivery
* purpose-built
* lots and lots of storage room

## ZOOX van (and amazon)
