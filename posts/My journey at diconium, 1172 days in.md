It was 1177 days ago when I embarked on an exciting journey with diconium, joining the team as an Advanced Product Owner. My professional background was a mosaic of start-up experiences, each tile a different product-related role that honed my expertise and resilience. But stepping into diconium, I faced something new â€“ an assembly of 'product owners,' a sight I had not encountered in my previous ventures.

The uniqueness of diconium was more than just its structure; the spirit of the company made it stand out. As the organization grew from a formidable team of 1000 to an even more impressive 2000, I marvelled at how each voice, including my own, resonated in the corridors of decision-making. The exponential growth never diluted the individuality of its employees; instead, it amplified the symphony of diverse ideas.

In this fertile environment, I evolved, becoming a futurist, an empathic leader, and an embodiment of agility. I learned and adapted to every challenge, applying forward-thinking solutions to problems, always grounded by empathy for my team and our users. I became an advocate of "agile by doing," a philosophy that became my guiding principle, helping me to navigate the complex currents of the digital world.

One of my proudest achievements during this transformative period was delivering several significant product increments for the VW world. I had a central role in creating their mobile charging apps, a milestone that pushed the boundaries of technology and sustainable transportation solutions.

Amidst all the professional growth, a personal transformation was happening too. I became calmer, more resilient. The whirlwind of the start-up world had seasoned me, but the culture of diconium allowed me to find serenity amidst the storm.

One aspect I hold dear to my heart is my role in fostering awareness of mental health and diversity within the organization. These were not just 'topics' for me but deeply personal issues that held the power to shape an inclusive, empathetic corporate culture.

My journey with diconium is more than a story of a product owner's growth. It's a testament to the power of an inclusive, innovative, and empathetic corporate culture that nurtures individuals to become leaders and change-makers. As I continue my journey, I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities, always staying agile, empathetic, and ready for the future.
