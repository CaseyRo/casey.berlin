*Long story short, I needed access to my RPi files after I wasn’t able to access them anymore. Those files were stored on an ext4 partition on my SD card, and my mac doesn’t read them.*

If that is what you’re looking for, congratulations! I hope this post will solve things for you, since I had to do this!

And if you’re like me, don’t simply `chmod` your `/etc` directory. A reminder for myself.

The solution at hand:

## Step 1: Run a Virtualbox with Ubuntu (live cd) on Your Mac

## Step 2: Mount Your SD Card into Your Virtualbox

To keep things simple for now, read this post:

I’ll update this post as soon as I have time, I want to make sure you’re finding what you need here.
