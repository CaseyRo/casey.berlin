**I've used GPT for:**
1. Thinking through a project idea. I wasn't that excited about the project I had for work, but GPT took away the boring stuff. Considering:
	1. Competition research / SWOT analysis
	2. Consider risks and challenges for scaling
	3. Defining a mission statement on the learnings thus far
	4. Making job descriptions for hiring the right people
