Gaslighting happens when managers and employees consider their future in remote, hybrid or in-office work, wether they like it or not.

Employees will want to stay home, they like the perceived freedom to plan the day and consider themselves more productive.

Managers lost control of their employees, have no idea what they're doing and are not really interested to find out. It is time to move into the future, but rather stick around in the past.

Leadership is needed in this case, not management.

I'm currently gathering information and researching this topic. Feel free to add!
