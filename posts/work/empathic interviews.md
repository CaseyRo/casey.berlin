When it comes to interviewing people, I think it isn't about asking about their history, looking at their resumes or figuring out if they can fit into a specific salary expectation.

I think interviews in 2023, also considering working remote, all come down to the person-to-person interaction. I consider myself very lucky being in a job and a company where I got 'chosen' to join not for what I've done in the past, but what I can, or want to be, in the future.

* For some people that future will be a 'top flight career', and achieving success, a big salary and growing in knowledge and experience.
* For some people that would be guiding others into becoming a better them, being in a leadership position and building teams.
* For some, they simply don't know yet.
* But all of them in the end are human beings â€“ beings we want to connect to, be part of the same company and build a strong, trusting and safe relationship.

**Some questions I like to ask:**

1. I hate suprises. What is something you can imagine trhat could go wrong right now, so that I'm not surprised when that happens? (Simon Sinek)
2. You are stranded on an island by your own and you can only pick three people to join you there. Who would it be?
