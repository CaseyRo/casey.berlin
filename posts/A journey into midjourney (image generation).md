I couldn't imagine a creative process to be so much fun â€“ I usually have difficulty visualising my thoughts. Still, midjourney is an excellent example of how text can become visual in seconds.

So let's start prompting, shall we?

## Midjourney v4, February 2023

Of course, I started with our dog because what else is essential in life? (see input picture further below)

![Sien as a jetson](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sien-as-a-jetson.jpeg)

```markdown
jetsons cartoon
```

And since my girlfriend works at a tour guide company that goes through Berlin by bike...

![Bike_company_example](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bike_company_example.jpeg)

```markdown
a modern logo for a tourguide company in berlin called "Berlin on bike",comic style,fresh
```

And asked for more variants on option #4:

![berlin on bike midjourney 2](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/berlin-on-bike-midjourney-2.jpeg)

I've also done a few variations on pictures from my girlfriend:

![girlfriend_midjourney_v4](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/girlfriend_midjourney_v4.jpeg)

![girlfriend_midjourney_v4_2](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/girlfriend_midjourney_v4_2.jpeg)

...and found the outcomes mediocre at best, to be honest.

Finally, I had to put myself to the test, mainly using the images/avatar you might know from my site / social media to inspire midjourney to make some crazy attempts.

...to turn me into an icon

![CaseyR_as_an_iconabstractmoderntech](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CaseyR_as_an_iconabstractmoderntech.jpeg)

```markdown
as an icon,abstract,modern,tech
```

...or a logo...

![CaseyR_as_logo_abstract_modern_tech](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CaseyR_as_logo_abstract_modern_tech.jpeg)

...or maybe a superhero?... (the model has some serious bias issues btw)

![CaseyR_superhero_fitness_ultrarealistic](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CaseyR_superhero_fitness_ultrarealistic.jpeg)

...but the cartoon/funny style made the best impression...

![CaseyR_cartoon_photorealistic_tech_summer_fun_happy_curious](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CaseyR_cartoon_photorealistic_tech_summer_fun_happy_curious.jpeg)

...which eventually led me into the dalli rabbit hole, ending up with this:

![casey_dalli](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/casey_dalli.jpeg)

So one of the nicest results might be something like this:

![bikeride_in_berlin_midjourneyv4](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bikeride_in_berlin_midjourneyv4.jpeg)

```markdown
group of people enjoying their bikeride in Berlin Germany, anime
```

(even though there's not much enjoyment to be seen)

## Here comes v5!

Many things happen in a short time, which means there is v5 of midjourney.

> [!NOTE] midjourney v5
> This model has very highÂ Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns withÂ [`--tile`](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/tile)

And well let's start with the prompt result I ended with in v4:

![group of people enjoying their bikeride in Berlin Germany midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/group-of-people-enjoying-their-bikeride-in-Berlin-Germany-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

as you can already see, the difference is quite huge. It seems the model has a different understanding of 'anime', and I potentially also primed it less well. So I made it a bit more clear:

![group of people enjoying their bikeride in Berlin Germany again midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/group-of-people-enjoying-their-bikeride-in-Berlin-Germany-again-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

```markdown
group of people enjoying their bikeride in Berlin Germany, anime cartoon style
```

and this already looks much more like a result that is usable (with some artifacts around the bikes) with some attention.

v5 creates some interesting (although fitting in a way) results when you lack decent prompts:

![dog midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dog-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

```markdown
cartoon style -s 1000
```
*(using a picture of our dog as input)*

With a single adjustment in the prompt, the result is a lot cooler:

![cartoon style dog v5 midjourney](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cartoon-style-dog-v5-midjourney.jpeg)

```markdown
cartoon style dog --s 250
```

And adding some imagination is the strong suit of these models:

![cartoon style dog in the snow](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cartoon-style-dog-in-the-snow.jpeg)

```markdown
cartoon style dog in the snow --s 500
```

For anyone asking, here's the original image I used to prompt the dog generation:

![Sien](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sien.jpeg)

### Cyberpunk (in Berlin)

I love science fiction, been a great fan of everything cyberpunk and for some reason gives me calm and some form of future perspective I both love and loathe.

So a great inspiration for some prompting!

![Cyberpunk Berlin 1](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cyberpunk-Berlin-1.jpeg)

```markdown
Berlin's brandenburger tor in cyberpunk style in 2222, late in the evening. It's raining, there's little people there. --s 1000 --ar 3:2 --v 5
```

![Cyberpunk Berlin midjourney v5 2](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cyberpunk-Berlin-midjourney-v5-2.jpeg)

```markdown
Berlin in cyberpunk style in 2222, early in the morning. The brandenburger tor in the background. It's raining, there's little people there. --s 1000
```

![Cyberpunk Berlin midjourney v5 3](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cyberpunk-Berlin-midjourney-v5-3.jpeg)

```markdown
Berlin in cyberpunk style in 2222, early in the morning, in the distance a hovertrain is leaving the train station. It's raining, there's little people there. --s 1000
```

Sometimes less is more, since in the last prompt it had too much train and too little Berlin.

So one more without Berlin (that I really liked):

![cyberpunky midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyberpunky-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

```markdown
a first person perspective from a cyberpunk city in 2222, late in the evening in neon lights, lots of people on the street photorealistic --s 1000
```

### Logo / icon generation in midjourney v5

I still had to try this, since well â€“ this is something a lot of people would want to do (and again used my regular avatar image to do so)

![casey R logo midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/casey-R-logo-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

![Casey Logo midjourney v5 3](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Casey-Logo-midjourney-v5-3.jpeg)

![Casey Logo midjourney v5 4](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Casey-Logo-midjourney-v5-4.jpeg)

```markdown
as a cartoon logo, futuristic but subtle, imaginative but down to earth. Inquisitive --s 1000
```

the last one is quite funny!

### Giving two images as prompt (and how it can go wrong quickly)

So I'm looking for a good look for me in a suit. I found an image on instagram I loved, added my own and prompted for result.

![red hair guy grey suit horribly wrong midjourney v5](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/red-hair-guy-grey-suit-horribly-wrong-midjourney-v5.jpeg)

![red hair guy grey suit horribly wrong midjourney v5 2](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/red-hair-guy-grey-suit-horribly-wrong-midjourney-v5-2.jpeg)

```markdown
combine these images so the red guy is in the grey suit, photorealistic --s 1000
```

the result is actually hilarious and could well be used for some kind of ad campaign for a suit (without a shoot!) but well, not completely what I was looking for ðŸ˜†

### Spark of creativity

So stepping away from reality / realism, I found a prompt like this to be fascinating:

```markdown
a group of people being in venice in the 17th century, taking a picture on top of a bridge, selfie style, enjoying themselves, men and women combined watercolor painting van gogh style --no phone --s 1000
```

![selfie waterpaint](https://casey.berlin/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/selfie-waterpaint.jpeg)

### the future, prompt engineering using chatGPT (?)

I will not go into detail too much, just watch this video:

the results are quite stunning:

## midjourney v4/v5 Conclusion

My idea of 'image manipulation' isn't the critical thought behind it â€“ midjourney is good in generating things, not adapting stuff you might have in your head.

Using it to improve your wedding pictures or turning things into a logo isn't the right perspective (yet).

It is there to create new things from already existing ones in their model. Of course, you could train the model, and I've seen successful blends of famous persons known to the model in new environments (which is a deep fake territory, and against the ToS).

I'll keep this post in progress while creating more stuff. I've done a few really cool logo's (from scratch) and hope to find more reasons to use it!
