It's a thing I promise in every company I join; I try to improve them by 1% every day.

As a freelancer, you can bring that in the effort you put into your work daily. When I was a consultant for Performance Solutions, we organised a "Social Friday" every so often to share knowledge and passion for customer experience.

Being a leader in a start-up or small company, you might be too busy to develop yourself, but guiding and mentoring your team members will bring that 1% extra every day to the company you work for. In my time at Oply I've seen junior people first joining a job and having huge expectations to change the world for instance â€“ and having no idea where to start.

Just pointing them in the right direction, setting focus and limiting distraction is a good start. Enabling them to do even better (figuring out they want to do something different)

In a bigger company, regardless of position, that 1% comes down to your personal development. What do you bring to the table? Perhaps that new tool makes your work better, quicker or of higher quality (looking at you chatGPT). Perhaps you are improving, based on training, feedback from others or self-reflection.
