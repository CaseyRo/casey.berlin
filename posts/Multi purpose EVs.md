Multi purpose EV‚Äôs

What I love about these new manufacturers is the way they look at building their vehicles. Technology like ‚Äòmicrofactories‚Äô (building vehicles with a lot less robots than a full assembly line) makes their options a lot more flexible/agile.

A base platform that is the same for each vehicle is something they also have in common. Companies like VW have developed those platforms too, but take a lot longer in my opinion.

Changing materials from steel to plastic based is another big change. It allows for easier repairs and better maintenance.

Examples of vehicles I‚Äôm tracking:

## CANOO MP vehicle

* starting from scratch in the EV environment
* purpose built
* platform base (bit like VW‚Äôs MBQ?)
* Comes from outside of the EU, much less politics

- looks like a concept, not going to happen in EU in this form.

* electric delivery
* purpose built
* lots and lots of storage room
