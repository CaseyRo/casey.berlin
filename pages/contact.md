This website is all you can get from me right now. We can discuss things over e-mail (when I have time), but I want you to know Iâ€™d share that conversation (with your permission) right here, as a way of payment.

> The thought processes we go through as human beings, are things we rarely capture - but contain all the value. Especially in the digital domain.

You'll find different means to contact me elsewhere on this page, please use them.

In case you have general questions, feel free to post them here as a comment.
