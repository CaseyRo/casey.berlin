I hope you clicked this page because of clickbait, because the story of me starting sports after 27 years of hating it, ended up with mediocre results (comparing it to the elite). But I am happy doing it! (And never expected that!)

## Green zone training
I’d love to believe that scientists know what they’re doing, especially when they’re on a TEDx video. I tried ‘green zone’ training using an apple watch to check my HR

## HIIT / TABATA / YGIG / AMRAP – enjoy the grind.

I don’t mind hard work. I don’t mind going way beyond my mental and physical boundaries. I don’t mind muscle pain. I enjoy the grind.

* HIIT = High intensity interval training
* TABATA = ?
* YGIG = You go I go (CrossFit)
* AMRAP = as many reps as possible (CrossFit)

Forget that you need ‘devices’, or ‘gear’ to get going with being more fit. If you are looking to get fitter, look down. Your belly will be there. Your lack of muscles, your posture will suck.

But I enjoy the grind. Doing a ‘buddy workout’ where both will end up on the floor, regardless of level, intensity or mass moved.

A good set of running shoes, a simple jumprope, or your own body weight is all you need to get started. 

A good trainer, a community to support and healthy habits helped me persist.

I’m still only averagely fit, have a belly that will hang around more the older I get, lack muscles and proper posture. But I enjoy the grind. Persistance is key, routine will get you through.

## Range of motion / flexibility

ROMWOD rocks.
