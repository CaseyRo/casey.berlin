I love the idea of keeping a bit of ‘now’ going on what I’m doing and what’s happening in my life.
See it as a personal limited view about what is going on _right now_, not what has happened in the past (I need a resume page for that around here)

Thanks for the inspiration [Frank Meeuwsen][1], and [Derek Sivers][2] on getting this all started!

# Work

1. I’m currently working as Product Owner at Diconium. I’m responsible for (a part of) the weconnect.ID app, this is taking most of my time these days.
2. I’m also “Team Lead”, pretty much meaning I’m coaching a team of Product Owners and Scrum Masters on the job. I love this part and am trying to extend it.
3. This always feels more hobby than work, I’m also consulting my better half at her company, [wattedoeninberlijn.nl][3] - and doing pretty much all the tech work there.

# Personal life

1. We’ve moved to a nice small village (lived in Berlin for 8 years) little over an hour travelling from the bustling city center. It has done well for mental and physical reasons, let alone the financial ones.
2. I’m engaged for 3 years now, COVID has kept us from getting married
3. Trying to cope with COVID as we all do, even though thanks to the move I feel this is my life now, things no longer feel on hold as before.

# Hobby

1. I do a few things for #WTDIB;
	1. Keeping a PHP, based on [Slim PHP][4] backend going. Connecting:
		1. Stripe
		2. Moneybird
		3. Sendgrid
		4. and some other API’s

	1. Building and maintaining a PHP/javascript frontend for people to book the (digital) tours my fiancee is organising (in Dutch) based on
		1. Plain JS (and Ok, Jquery #sorrynotsorry)
		2. TailwindCSS
		3. Mustache
		4. Stripe

	1. Doing some background analysis and feeding curiosity with
		1. Sentry
		2. Segment
		3. Cypress.io

2. I have a big interest in home automation, using NodeRed to have a system that is not depending on a single supplier too much (except Apple for the UI). It connects the following parts;
	1. Lights, outlets and switches using [zigbee2mqtt][5]
	2. IP based devices from [Shelly][6]
	3. “Some” logic in nodered enabling pretty much everything automatically
	4. And _everything_ is of course running on one of my raspberry Pi’s!

3. I picked up photography again
4. I started running again after gaining 12 KG during the corona period. Together with mobility exercises I’m getting into a flow again, 3 runs a week and 4-5 range of motion workouts.

# Reading

1. ‘The expanse’ series

# Gaming

I’m a casual gamer, so I enjoy a lot of games but on my ‘currently playing’ list are:

1. Forza Horizon 5
2. Devil may cry series (bloody palace in DMC5 currently)
