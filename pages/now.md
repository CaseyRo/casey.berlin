I love the idea of keeping a bit of ‘now’ going on what I’m doing and what’s happening in my life.
See it as a personal limited view about what is going on _right now_, not what has happened in the past.

Thanks for the inspiration [Frank Meeuwsen][1], and [Derek Sivers][2] on getting this all started!

# Work

1. I’m currently working as Product Owner at Diconium. I’m responsible for (a part of) the weconnect.ID app, this is taking most of my time these days.
2. I’m also “Team Lead”, pretty much meaning I’m coaching a team of Product Owners and Scrum Masters on the job. I love this part!
3. Wonder if this is more ‘work’ than ‘hobby’, but I’m also consulting my better half at her company, [wattedoeninberlijn.nl][3] - and doing pretty much all the tech work there. See hobbies for what that entails

# Personal life

1. We’ve moved to a nice small village (lived in Berlin for 8 years) little over an hour travelling from the bustling city center in Berlin
2. I’m engaged for 3 years already, COVID has kept us from getting married
3. Trying to cope with COVID as we all do

# Hobby

1. As mentioned in work, I do a few things for #WTDIB;
    1. Keeping a PHP, based on [Slim PHP][4] backend going. Connecting:
        1. Stripe
        2. Moneybird
        3. Sendgrid
        4. and some other API’s healthy and ongoing

    2. Building and maintaining a PHP/javascript frontend for people to book the (digital) tours my fiancee is organising (in Dutch) based on
        1. VanillaJS
        2. TailwindCSS
        3. Mustache
        4. Stripe

    3. Doing some background analysis and curiosity things with
        1. Sentry (for debugging)
        2. Segment (for analytics)

2. Next to that I have a big interest in home automation, using NodeRed to have a system that is not depending on a single supplier too much. It connects the following parts;
    1. Lights, outlets and switches using [zigbee2mqtt][5]
    2. IP based devices from [Shelly][6]
    3. “Some” logic in nodered enabling pretty much everything automatically
    4. And _everything_ is of course running on one of my raspberry Pi’s!

3. I picked up photography again
4. I started running again after gaining 12 KG during the corona years. Together with mobility exercises I’m getting into a flow again

# Reading

1. ‘The expanse’ series

# Gaming

I’m a casual gamer, so I enjoy a lot of games but on my ‘currently playing’ list are:

1. Control (series X edition)
2. Forza Horizon 5
3. Diablo III (until the next one arrives)
4. Devil may cry series (bloody palace in DMC5 currently)
