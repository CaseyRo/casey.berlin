I love the idea of keeping a bit of ‚Äònow‚Äô going on what I‚Äôm doing and what‚Äôs happening in my life.
See it as a personal limited view about what is going on _right now_, not what has happened in the past (I need a resume page for that around here)

<b class=‚Äúbullshit‚Äù>something inspirational</b>

Thanks for the inspiration [Frank Meeuwsen][1], [Derek Sivers][2] and especially [Harry Kellert][3] on getting this all started!

# Work

1. I‚Äôm currently working as Product Owner at Diconium. Responsible for (a part of) the [weconnect.ID app][4], this is taking most of my time these days.
2. Additionally, coaching as ‚ÄúTeam Lead‚Äù, of Product Owners and Scrum Masters on the job. I love this part, and I am trying to extend it.
3. This always feels more hobby than work, I‚Äôm consulting my better half at her company, [wattedoeninberlijn.nl][5] ‚Äì and doing the tech work there.

# Personal life

1. Recently moved to a nice small village (lived in Berlin for 8 years) little over an hour travelling from the bustling city center. The move has done us well, both for mental and physical reasons.
2. I‚Äôm engaged for 3 years now, COVID-19 has kept us from getting married
3. Trying to cope with COVID-19 as we all do, even though thanks to the move I feel this is my life now, things no longer feel on hold as before.

# Hobby

1. I do a few things for #WTDIB;
	1. Keeping a PHP, based on [Slim PHP][6] REST API backend going. Connecting:
		1. Google sheets (as database, no joke üòâ) 
		2. Stripe
		3. Moneybird
		4. Sendgrid
		5. SQLite
		6. Nodered
		7. and some other APIs

	1. Building and maintaining a PHP/javascript frontend for people to book the (digital) tours my fianc√©e is organising (in Dutch) based on
		1. Plain JS (with jQuery and Lodash splashed around for laziness)
		2. TailwindCSS
		3. Mustache
		4. Stripe

	1. Doing background analysis, feeding curiosity with
		1. Sentry
		2. Segment
		3. Cypress.io

2. I have a big interest in home automation, using NodeRed to have a system that is independent of any single supplier (except Apple for the UI). This system connects the following parts;
	1. Lights, outlets, and switches using [zigbee2mqtt][7]
	2. IP-based devices from [Shelly][8]
	3. ‚ÄúSome‚Äù logic in nodered, enabling pretty much everything automatically
	4. And _everything_ is, of course, running on one of my Raspberry Pi‚Äôs!

3. I picked up photography again
4. Being currently injured is my biggest ‚Äòpain‚Äô, so no running or crossfit for the moment
5. Reading up / watching a lot of F1 content recently, since the new season is coming!
# Reading

1. ‚ÄòThe expanse‚Äô series
2. Waiting for the next Obama book

# Gaming

I‚Äôm a casual gamer, so I enjoy numerous games but on my ‚Äòcurrently playing‚Äô list are:

![Cyberpunk][image-1]

1. Cyberpunk 2077 (patch 1.5 is very solid)
2. F1 2021 (catching up for the season)
3. Minecraft Dungeons (co-op is fun!)

Played recently (not bored with it yet)
1. DMC5
2. Forza Horizon 5
