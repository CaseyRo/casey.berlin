I love the idea of keeping a bit of ‘now’ going on what I’m doing and what’s happening in my life.
See it as a personal limited view about what is going on _right now_, not what has happened in the past (todo for myself: I need a resume page for that around here)

Thanks for the inspiration [Frank Meeuwsen][1], [Derek Sivers][2] and especially [Harry Kellert][3] on getting this all started and being part of the [now movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

# Work

1. I’m currently working as Senior Product Owner at Diconium. In my road to becoming a director I'm supporting a lot of projects in figuring out what they actually need to solve their problems.
2. Additionally, coaching as “Team Lead” of Product Owners and Scrum Masters on the job. I love this part, watching people grow is exciting!
3. Considering my future, doing a lot of self reflection at the moment.

# Personal Life

1. Moved to a nice small village (lived in Berlin for 8 years) little over an hour travelling from the bustling city centre. The move has done us well, both for mental and physical reasons. 2 years have flown past and we feel amazing here!
2. I’ve been engaged for 4,5 years now, COVID-19 has kept us from getting married, but this year it will happen!
3. Sien has joined our life, a small (but 20 KG) ball of love, happiness and playfulness. A missing link in my life!

# Hobby

1. I have a big interest in home automation, using NodeRed (now with home assistant as UI) to have a system that is independent of any single supplier (~~except Apple for the UI~~). This system connects the following parts;
	1. Lights, outlets, and switches using [zigbee2mqtt][7]
	2. IP-based devices from [Shelly][8], ~~considering a Tasmota flash though!~~
	3. “Some” logic in node-red, enabling daily routines and circadian lighting automatically
	5. Using home-assistant as the 'frontend' of this, expanding my options to visualise things a lot more
	6. And _everything_ is, of course, running on a few of my Raspberry Pi’s in docker swarm (and a mac mini M2 running ubuntu as a VM)

3. I picked up photography again, with a FUJI XE-4 and a DJI mini 3 pro
4. Rowing, running and jump-roping my way through the week physically (next to walking Sien)

# Reading

1. I just finished 'snow crash' – which is stunningly accurate from a book written in 1994.
2. I started reading 'the wager' – an excellent pirate meets fact book based on an English ship from the 18th century.

# Gaming

I’m a casual gamer, so I enjoy numerous games but on my ‘currently playing’ list are:

1. Waiting for Diablo IV.
2. Really that's it.
