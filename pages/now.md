<excerpt> I love the idea of keeping a bit of ‘now’ going on what I’m doing and what’s happening in my life.
See it as a personal limited view about what is going on _right now_, not what has happened in the past (I need a resume page for that around here)\</excerpt>

Thanks for the inspiration [Frank Meeuwsen][1], [Derek Sivers][2] and especially [Harry Kellert][3] on getting this all started!

# Work

1. I’m currently working as Senior Product Owner at Diconium. Responsible for (a part of) the [weconnect.ID app][4], this is taking most of my time these days.
2. Additionally, coaching as “Team Lead”, of Product Owners and Scrum Masters on the job. I love this part, and I am trying to extend it.
3. Considering my future at this website.

# Personal life

1. Recently moved to a nice small village (lived in Berlin for 8 years) little over an hour travelling from the bustling city centre. The move has done us well, both for mental and physical reasons.
2. I’ve been engaged for 4 years now, COVID-19 has kept us from getting married, but this year it will happen!
3. Sien has joined our life, a small (but 20 KG) ball of love, happiness and playfulness. A missing link in my life!

# Hobby

1. I have a big interest in home automation, using NodeRed to have a system that is independent of any single supplier (except Apple for the UI). This system connects the following parts;
	1. Lights, outlets, and switches using [zigbee2mqtt][7]
	2. IP-based devices from [Shelly][8], considering a tasmota flash though!
	3. “Some” logic in node-red, enabling pretty much everything automatically
	4. Using homekit as the 'frontend' of this, although most of it is running automatically
	5. And _everything_ is, of course, running on one of my Raspberry Pi’s (and a mac mini M2 running ubuntu as a VM)
		1. Docker swarm (I know there's k8s) as a redundancy measure

3. I picked up photography again, with a FUJI XE-4 and a DJI mini 3 pro
4. Rowing, running and jump-roping my way through the week physically (next to walking Sien)
5. Reading up / watching a lot of F1 content recently, since the new season is coming!

# Reading

1. Nothing special currently, just finished "the glass jar" which was phenomenal and so relevant.

# Gaming

I’m a casual gamer, so I enjoy numerous games but on my ‘currently playing’ list are:

1. Fifa 2023
2. Hades (still fun to do a run from time to time)
3. Waiting for Diablo IV
