The difference between *how* and *what* is blurry - I’d like to share my definitions here, consider them whilst you’re snooping around on this site. If you skipped the [why, go back to start](https://casey.berlin/pages/why/). You will not receive $ 20.000.

My *how* is a ‘guide to the galaxy’, a set of processes, my ‘magic tricks’, the hard work. It’s the thing you would hire me for, to talk how we get from 0 to 1, building a relationship with your first customer, developing (with) your (SAFe) product team or improving your mobile app from 2 to 5 stars (I know your pain!)

The *how* is the discussion we have considering your business idea, pitch, or formatted vision / mission statements (hint: I don’t do well in vision workshops, call me when you’re done with that!) - and *how* to bring that idea to reality.

You call me to plan and build your next agile increment, sharpen your OKR’s or to fast forward an idea to a working prototype. Regardless if that’s with 10 or 100 people. My every day learnings is what I bring to the table, I’m not the academic, I practice *before* I preach.

You’ll find a lot of my *hows* on this website. Thoughts captured in raw format posts, sketches, bits of code and youtube videos. I’ve never called myself a perfectionist or finisher, and you won’t find a 100% solution here. I’ll keep adjusting things, re-post them or take them away if they’re irrelevant. Bookmark what you think is great, ask questions and feel free to add your thoughts -- I want to learn *how* others think, every day!
